- 👋 Hey, I’m @importshark
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS/TS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mostly any javascript projects you have. I have a busy schedule but i'd love to help with your project! (Smaller projects preferably, thanks)
- 📫 How to reach me: The best way to reach me is on discord. You can send a friend request to ~Shark#0360 or join my server at https://discord.gg/vAyFknQczv
-Just in case you were wondering, most of my respositories are private, that's why it doesn't look like much
