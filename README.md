- 👋 Hey, I’m @importshark
- 🌱 I’m pretty fluent in JavaScript/Typescript, so I'm exploring right now! Working in C#, with MAUI, Kotlin...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any smaller projects projects you have. I have a busy schedule but i'd love to help! 
- 📫 How to reach me: The best way to reach me is on discord. You can send a friend request to asharkinthevoid on discord or join my server at https://discord.gg/vAyFknQczv
